# CRM for BB

A local-first, agent-native CRM workspace that runs as a BB extension.

This project ports the MIT-licensed [Comp AI CRM](https://github.com/trycompai/crm)
into BB. It preserves the source product's table-first company, contact, deal,
activity, enrichment, integration, and agent workflows. The interface uses BB
theme tokens and version-matched vendored components.

The implementation is in progress. The full parity contract and phased task
breakdown live in [docs/PORT_PLAN.md](docs/PORT_PLAN.md).

## Install

From a local clone:

```sh
npm install
bb plugin install . --yes
bb plugin dev
```

From the public Git repository:

```sh
bb plugin install https://github.com/juanbermudez/bb-plugin-crm
```

## Development

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

The BB SDK surface is pinned in `devDependencies`. Sync it to a different BB
release before changing plugin APIs:

```sh
bb plugin types
```

Vendored UI source lives in `components/ui`. Add version-matched components
from BB's registry and keep runtime-shimmed dependencies in `devDependencies`.

## Architecture

- `server.ts` wires the plugin server surfaces.
- `app.tsx` registers the CRM application inside BB.
- `db/` owns SQLite migrations and record stores.
- `contracts/` owns strict RPC boundary schemas.
- `services/` owns CRM domain behavior and integrations.
- `app/` and `views/` own the BB-native interface.
- `skills/crm/SKILL.md` teaches BB agents the CRM workflow.
- `docs/PORT_PLAN.md` is the parity contract and delivery plan.
